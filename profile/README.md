# 👋 Welcome the Community Lorebooks!

**Status**: We'll be opening up signups after ironing out the docs and more soon. :)

A free subdomain service for digital garden, wiki and documentation sites for individual and communities alike
(non-commerical sites only), as well as home of [RecapTime.dev](https://github.com/recaptime-dev)'s documentation
related projects (the [Squad Wiki](https://wiki.recaptime.dev) repo is hosted at <https://mau.dev/recaptime-dev/squad/wiki>).

Learn more at <https://lorebooks.wiki>

## 🌈 Get involved

- 🌐 [Get started by claiming your free `subdomain.lorebooks.wiki`](https://lorebooks.wiki/docs/get-started). No bloated JS dashboards,
just pure Git(Hub/Lab) flow. (Using email or sourcehut? We're working on that too.)
- ❤️ Sponsor Andrei Jiroh's open-source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ajhalili2006). (We'll be opening
up dedicated options for directly support the project in the future.) (More ways at <https://sponsors.andreijiroh.dev>)
- 👥 [Apply as community maintainer](https://lorebooks.wiki/docs/maintainers#apply) (or even beter
[join the Recap Time Squad crew](https://recaptime.dev/join).

## 💵 Who's paying the bills?

Currently @ajhalili2006 is paying the bills for domain renewals (USD 20.06 each for `lorebooks.wiki` and
`stellapent.wiki`, USD 12.85 for `recaptime.dev`) and email (relatively we use Uberspace at EUR 1 tier for now,
currently in trial) out of his weekly student allowance and personal savings. It would be nice if you can chip
in even some spare USD 5 to keep things up and running by sponsoring his open-source work through the links above.

(For those asking, we're in the works with Hack Club on [fiscal sponsorship](https://hackclub.com/hcb) behind the scenes.
Once we're signed the required paperwork, we'll update this section with additional information.)
