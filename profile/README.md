**Status**: [@ajhalili2006][ajhalili2006] shipped during High Seas, but still cooking behind the scenes

A free subdomain service for digital gardens, wikis, and other documentation sites for individuals and communities
alike (non-commercial sites or non-profit use only), as well as the home of [RecapTime.dev][rtdev]'s documentation-related
projects (the [Squad Wiki][wiki] repo is hosted separately at the main organization on [GitLab SaaS][wiki-repo]
([GitHub mirror](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/wiki)).

## üåà Get involved

- üåê [Get started by claiming your free `subdomain.lorebooks.wiki`](https://lorebooks.wiki/docs/getting-started/). No bloated
JS dashboards, just pure Git(Hub/Lab) flow. (Using email over sourcehut? We're working on that too.)
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Sponsor our service and projects via [GitHub Sponsors][sponsors] or at [HCB][hcb]. More ways at
<https://lorebooks.wiki/donate>, especially for those who want to send us bank checks and crypto, plus corporate
sponsorships and more.
- üë• [Apply as community maintainer](https://lorebooks.wiki/docs/maintainers#apply) (or even better
[join the Recap Time Squad crew](https://recaptime.dev/team/join)).

## üíµ Who's paying the bills?

Currently, [@ajhalili2006][ajhalili2006] is paying the bills for domain renewals (USD 20.06 each for `lorebooks.wiki` and
`stellapent.wiki`, USD 12.85 for `recaptime.dev`) and email (relatively we use [Heliohost][heliohost] alongside [Help Scout][hpsct],
previously Uberspace at EUR 1 tier and Heliohost) out of a portion of my weekly student allowance and personal savings. Although I do have
years of domain registration left (thanks to High Seas YSWS domain credits at Cloudflare Registrar), consider chipping in for at least
USD 3-5 to keep the service and its infrastructure running.
