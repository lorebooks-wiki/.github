# 👋 Welcome to the Community Lorebooks!

**Status**: Getting ready before the end of High Seas 👀

A free subdomain service for digital garden, wiki, and documentation sites for individuals and communities alike
(non-commercial sites only), as well as the home of [RecapTime.dev](https://github.com/recaptime-dev)'s documentation
related projects (the [Squad Wiki](https://wiki.recaptime.dev) repo is hosted at <https://mau.dev/recaptime-dev/squad/wiki>).

Learn more at <https://lorebooks.wiki>

## 🌈 Get involved

- 🌐 [Get started by claiming your free `subdomain.lorebooks.wiki`](https://lorebooks.wiki/docs/get-started). No bloated
JS dashboards, just pure Git(Hub/Lab) flow. (Using email over sourcehut? We're working on that too.)
- ❤️ Sponsor our service and projects via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lorebooks-wiki). More ways at
<https://lorebooks.wiki/donate>, especially for those who want to send us bank checks and crypto, plus corporate
sponsorships and more.
- 👥 [Apply as community maintainer](https://lorebooks.wiki/docs/maintainers#apply) (or even better
[join the Recap Time Squad crew](https://recaptime.dev/team/join).

## 💵 Who's paying the bills?

Currently, @ajhalili2006 is paying the bills for domain renewals (USD 20.06 each for `lorebooks.wiki` and
`stellapent.wiki`, USD 12.85 for `recaptime.dev`) and email (relatively we use Uberspace at EUR 1 tier)
out of a portion of his weekly student allowance and personal savings. It would be nice if you could chip
in even some spare USD 5 to keep things up and running by sponsoring our efforts through the links above.
